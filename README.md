# Washing Machine
A cute washing machine made for no particular reason.ðŸ’•

You'll need [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) to process the .scss file - comes pre-installed on Mac!
Then just run `sass machine.scss machine.css` in the project directory.

Open the html file (in a browser obvs) & you're off.

## Left to do:
- [ ] Bubbles coming out of machine
- [ ] Drag and drop dirty clothes into the machine
- [ ] Knob turns the machine on (clothes inside spin)
